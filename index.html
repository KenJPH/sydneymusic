    <h1>Welcome to Joseph's Muso Home Page!</h1>

    <div id="intro">
        <p>This site isn't going to hang around very long.</p>
        
        <p>We're just going back to the start.</p>

        <p><strong>It will evolve into something else soon.</strong></p>
        
        <p>We just lost our souls a bit with Web 2.0, and <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">Web 3.0 is worse</a>, so we're going back to the start. </div>

    <h2>Music Writing</h2>

    <p>A small body of work featuring music writing from the past and present can be found on the <a href="/writings.html">Writings</a> page.</p>

    <p>&raquo; <a href="/writings.html">Go to the Writings page</a></p>

    <h2>Sydney's Music Scene</h2>

    <h3>Live Music</h3>

    <p>The most comprehensive free, completely bullshitless and absolutely sponcon-free <strong>overview of Sydney's music scene</strong>, updated daily, is available over on the <a href="/gigs.html">Gigs page</a>.</p>
    <p>There are instructions for submitting your gig if you wish to.</p>
    
    <p>It will be wildly incomplete to begin with but <strong>with your help we can make this incredible</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>We will credit every single person that submits something at the bottom of the page, and you can have a link to your website or social media account next to your name if you wish. That means you get to contribute to having an identity in making Sydney's music scene visible. It's the least we can do. This is about building community.</p>

    <p>&raquo; <a href="/gigs.html">Go to the Gigs page</a></p>

    <h3>Dance, Dance, Dance</h3>

    <p>We intend to compile the most comprehensive overview of what's happening in the clubs, at the raves, who to watch and where to go. If you'd like to contribute your knowledge, please do <a href="mailto:contact@sydneymusic.net">contact us</a>!</p>

    <p>&raquo; Rave directory coming soon!</p>

    <h2>Discord</h2>

    <p><s>We want to set up</s> <strong>We have a</strong> Discord, so we can have a more dynamic and discussion-oriented place for Sydney's music community to meet. It's about as Web 2.0 as it gets around here. No doubt there are many already. But this will be attached to this little corner. If you'd like to join our Discord, <a href="mailto:contact@sydneymusic.net">contact us</a>.</p>

    <h2>History ("why the weird name?") and Why</h2>

    <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970323074950/http://www.northnet.com.au/~hardy/">The first website I ever built was made in 1996 when I was 11</a>. It was called "Joseph's Muso Home Page" and it was built the same way I built this site. Except back then I was panicking because I was learning HTML for the first time and none of it made sense. Now it's all coming back to my fingers like it never went away. And yes it's primitive and yes it uses just about none of the technology that I've helped teams make use of in the 25 years since, but I know that this primitive technology still contains power.</p>

    <p>Therefore, now you get the fastest, most convenient resource imaginable: but it's from a tiny group of people, not a social media feed full of hundreds if not thousands of people attempting to get attention. Just us. And if you like it, you like it and you return to it. If you don't like it, you never come back. Or maybe you'll never hear of it, and it won't make a scrap of difference to your life. That's fine. The only problem is, it's not succinct. We ramble a lot. But that's fine.</p>

    <p>Joseph's Muso Home Page is going back to the start because when I was an 11 year old, within a week I started getting emails from strangers all over the world with comments about what I was writing. Some of it didn't make a lot of sense. Some people were just excited to find someone on the internet writing about something they were interested in. It wasn't very good. But it happened.</p>

    <p>We're going to try and stay semantically pure and yes this is nostalgic, but this isn't going to be Client Liason-style nostalgia. I'm not about to introduce webrings and guestbooks and shit like that. We're going to use the internet smart. But this is how I'm going to go about it. Starting from basics.</p>

    <p>We'll trim this down, make it prettier, implement smarter technology when we're ready to do so. But for now it starts here. And it starts with just me and hopefully my friends if they want to join in. Can't wait til it's a group of people instead.</p>

    <p><strong>This site intends to promote the community that music creates.</strong></p>
    
    <p>It intends to show you where music is, specifically in Sydney, Australia. We want to feature the spaces and places that are doing amazing stuff, but hopefully contains enough beauty of relevance to other people from other places too. Welcome, wherever you are.</p>

    <p>We also think music media in Sydney by and large sucks and this is really just suggesting that we need to do a rethink that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Goes back to basics</li>
        <li>Is community-minded</li>
        <li>Isn't attempting to shove shitty vodka products or lifestyle accessories down our throats</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>A few promises:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>This site will never include content from a different server to the one it's hosted on. That includes: scripts, images, downloads. There will never be Google Analytics. You're free. Any external content will be linked.</li>
        <li>I will never have your information pass through or be stored on my server, unless you explicitly choose to email something. I'll make an exception for access logs, because that's just diagnostic information. You will never be identfiably profiled.</li>
        <li>If you are writing to contribute content to this website, your email forms a sort of written contract that the content you provide can be used on this website if you explicitly state that to be your wishes.</li>
        <li>We may start our own music events or projects. We promise to never promote our own stuff with greater prominence via this website than anything else that's going on.</li>
        <li>We will editorially feature content but we will never accept payment for any feature of content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Acknowledgement of Country</h3>

    <p>This website was created on the unceded lands on the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. We acknowledge their legacy and extend our respects to their elders past, present and emerging. We extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders today.</p>

    <h2>Donation</h2>

    <p>If at any point you find you like what we're doing, you can donate. Do that by asking us how. We haven't thought about how yet, because we don't think what we've created has any value yet. But when you do think we've created some value, <a href="mailto:contact@sydneymusic.net">e-mail us</a> and we'll talk about how we can best allow you to do that. And then we'll let everyone else know what we came up with here when that happens.</p>

    <p>You could also just donate to a cause you care about if you like what we do, because we have jobs and don't really need the money. But let us know if this prompted you to do so, because we'd love to know.</p>
